# Natural Language Processing in 2018 (learn_nlp_2018)
I am interested in building up a curriculum that would be like a masters-level understanding of text analysis NLP. I want to have a firm understanding of theory, history and modern applied practice.

## Prerequisites / Background Knowledge

I will update this list as I go through with details and resources around what exactly was needed in these areas. 
* Python
    * String Algorithms and manipulation
        * https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/?search=string
    * Generators / streaming
        * http://www.dabeaz.com/generators-uk/
* Linear Algebra
* Calculus
* Probability
    * http://athenasc.com/probbook.html
* Statistics
* Foundations of Machine Learning

## Objective
How can I match the same materials I would get in a masters-level NLP program?
